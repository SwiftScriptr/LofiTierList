    <title>The Best composers</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>The masters of lofi albums</h2>
    <p>
        Here will be a shortlist of curators I reccomend to check out due to their consistent passion of their graft. <br>
        These artists either have a multitude of talents or do the best unique take on musical story-telling that seperates them from others; <br>
        simply put, their consistency isn't a 'Brand' of music but rather they creatively pop out <em>Quality</em> music establishing their own preferences and flare. <br>
        These guys therefore have pumped out enough content over the last decade (and a half to those OG social media composers on YT)
        Please note that the top 5 reccomendations are in no particular order, except from one french dude which I respect the most for his talents; <br>
        those outside the five will have joint positions in the 6th position respectively.
    </p>    
    <ul>
        <li><h3>L'ind√©cis</h3></li>
        <p>
           This classy <a title="I believe he is French after seeing one of his descriptions on YT and his alias sounds french"><em>Frenchman</em></a> is IMO a true ambassidor of the lofi space.<br>
           What you will find in his roster is a list of @chillhop <a title="what I describe as tracks that are a reoccuring hits on their livestreams"> <em>staples</em></a>, one of the top hubs for creators to post their media on for all to view along side the bigger @LofiGirl channel. <br>
           The differnce being that chillhop as it implies is hiphop oriented but inclusive of jazz, funk, house music and RnB. <br>
           What seperates him is the skill it takes to apply classical principles to his albums/EP's; there is an abundance of fluidity and intention in his compilations. <br>
           I promise you won't feel an awkward feeling when hearing his over 30 min masterpieces. Thats hard to do lyrically let alone Instrumentally.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Philanthrope</h3></li>
        <p>
            This creator has alot of dope tunes in his closet and is also a great collaborator (his main strength), in terms of his albums (of which i haven't haerd all of them) <br>
            it is fair to say they are raw and not upbeat, instead mostly mellow and simultaneously grandoise and vulnerable, <br> allowing you to accept most journeys aren't perfect but still worth completing.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Arbour</h3></li>
        <p>
            This artist took a while for me to investigate his ensamble; once I looked into his collection, I was impressed. I like his style due to it being unorthrodox, nostalgic and grungy.
            He stands out due to not mentaining a 'brand' of music but creating differences within his 4 albums i have. Lastly, 1/5 of his work has mature, old-school hiphop vibes. 
        </p>
        <li><h3>Aviino</h3></li>
        <p>
            In terms of albums, the quality of music produced by this creator is second to none, this is a consistent artist, 80% of every album he makes are memorable;
            the purpose of lofi is to be able to multitask without conflicting with your hobbies, projects or given assignments. Aviino fits the bill, you will certainly see his name again.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Nymano</h3></li>
        <p>
            The mix of vocally inputted tunes along with dope beats and sometimes voiced over scripts are why this artist overshines the others in their joint posistions. <br>
            The music feels like productions and OST's of shows that I can relate to due to the impact of the songs.
        </p> 

        <li><h3>Joint 6th place</h3></li>
        <p>
            These guys got photo finnished out of the top half of the chart due to a couple of reasons; a lack of evolution and nuance as time elapsed, heavy reliance on a set of instruments, <br> 
            and no clear-cut creativity. The more flavours I heard along my Journey, the more music I prefered over them. <br>
            Blue-Wednesday: Too much piano and EP's don't get progressively better over time only have two of 5 in total. Although collabs are worthwhile in a balanced instrument line-up. <br>
    <br>            
            Aso: Was and is still creative however not many new releases of recent. <br>
    <br>
            SleepyFish: Although his content dominates the lofi sector, not all of his tunes are of major impact, only a couple of albums switch up his style.
