    <h2>Solos that are made to last</h2>
    <p> 
        Here will be a shortlist of soloists I reccomend to check out due to their ability to create unassociated singles. <br>
        These artists either have a nack of making a refreshing dope tunes that allows nostalgia to flow; <br>
        are not bohtered to struggle to make a succession of quality music, or they stray away from potential burnout of creativity.<br>
        I believe that regardless of wether they have a few Albums or not, their best cards in their deck are true lofi Staples <br>
        Please note that the top 5 reccomendations are in order, particularly for artists that have made alot of solo tracks and collabs; <br>
        those outside the five will have joint positions in the 6th position respectively.
    </p>

    <li><h3>Ian Ewing</h3></li>
<p>
    A borderlining mature/intimate artist. This creator has one album (that I am aware of) that slaps as an all time fav, see Top5 15-20 Min EPs to find out more. <br>
    His approach is very hip and RnB, although he has specifically seperated his IP of vocalist collabs and songs from his Lofi contributions, it's not an issue for him to express his taste instrumentally.
    A man of many tallents who wears multiple <em>hats</em>  in production, but is not afraid to share workloads with his bros. 
</p>

<li><h3>Birocratic</h3></li>
<p>
    To date, this New yorker hasn't made any albums I am aware of, and I'm not sure if he's retired. However, he was one the first on the @Chillhop radio that inspired me to come back for more.
    An artist that collabs and contributes in the many themes of chillhop EP's on their YT and soundcloud; seasonal albums (est. 2016), ChillStudyBeats and chillTapes; <br>
    along with some other periodic titles on the platform. A soloist who makes his own music when he has the time to.
</p>

<li><h3>Cloudchord</h3></li>
<p>
    This artist is as much of a collaborator as a soloist. He's only made one album thats worth it's salt but is a 60% welldone steak IMO (the succession and fluidity could do some work but I won't completely blame him) <br>
    You will see it in the collabed album Top10 Under 30 mins long and the standout tracks in the top 30 singles (as I see them as singles holding the album together and not a cohesive part of the album because they are better). <br>
    Nevertheless, the singles he's co-produced listed elswhere on htis blogspace are prestigious and 100% welldone.
</p>

<li><h3>Stan Forbee</h3></li>
<p>
There are few artists that know how to layer and develop a track quite like this guy, he can flex between romanticism and funky beats, nothing is off the table for him. <br>
Although I'm sure he has a few albums, his opening in this one album he co-produced that I do have (Bloom) stand out from the rest there are a few other tracks in the top 30. <br>
</p>

<li><h3>Kupla</h3></li>
<p>To be fair, this last pick was one that I had to settle with due to the amount of tunes I had under his collabs and solos. <br>
    It was a mix between him and the first list on the joint 6th place. And I couldn't ignore the talent and refreshing use of the piano unlike BlueWednesday.
    Specificly the <em>NON</em>-muted/muffled or suppressed sound of it, even resonably priced schoolgrade mobile keys can sound less muted.
</p>

<li><h3>Joint 6th Place</h3></li>

<p> Psalm Trees: Has a few EP's and collabs and is a breath of fresh air. Chilling is the main objective with a few intimate tracks, due to the limited content, <br>
    this person may as well be a soloist. The uniqueness is admireable like the niches of classical and true open mike flows. <br>
    <br>
    Leavv: Limited content but considered a soloist with oldschool vibes. <br>
    <br>
    Knownmadic: Sombering artist specifically skilled with strings and synths at the same time, his album will be listed in the under Top5 EP's under 30 min categories.
</p>
</ol>

<p>
    I hope the selection was easy to follow, Anyone who Isn't on the lists will be featured elsewhere as they are more akin to collaborations and co-productions. <br>
     A brief disclaimer based on the content displayed: whatever is digitally available is the primary factor to the judgement of their ranking. I can only rank what I can find.
