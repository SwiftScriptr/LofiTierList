    <h2>If two's a party then three's festival</h2>
    <p>
        In this list you will (or would of noticed) on your Lofi Odysee reoccurring names being featured on album cover playlists during a livestream <br>
        and the many channel distributers exposing lofi, showing the artists together in the description or title on YT which is alot easier to see. <br>
        Here you will find the most common folks that respect eachother as musicians, have general friendships or are willing to learn and grow from shared experiences.
        Besides, in the independent artist industry, it is easier to create something truly unique together... <br> 
        and to share the blame with your tight colleagues when being accused of sounding to similar in copywrite infringements XD.<br>
    <br>
        Only joking, I'm sure the community isn't toxic like that and I have some few examples proving that. <br>
        L'Indecis music was used as a televised as BG music for a POP summer competition advert 5-7 ish years ago (a track from his album 2nd Wind, well before I knew what LOfi was)
    <br>
        And Blue Wednesday has done paid requests for Mark Robe almost a year ago now. <br>
        Point being, in this space as long as their is fairuse and sources to original companies and/or the artists themselves. 
        They are satisfied that their music is getting exposure and they are actively being contacted for paid requests. <br>
        Free commercials and references inspire non commercial copywrited payed requests; #CreditTheCreators

        <li><h3>G Mills</h3></li>
        <P>
            Alot of creators have shared studios or jam sessions with this guy even more than himself with other people (well based on what some title orders of singles suggests) <br>
            This artist is a clear talent and 'work buddy' so it would seem, a slow chilled synth and strings expert worth the exposure. (mostly found on @LofiGirl)
        </P>
        <li><h3>SwuM</h3></li>
        <P>
            This artist is a talent interested in the ChillHop BeatTapes sector, one of the few regular 'record' series on the @ChillHop channel 2-3 times yearly. <br>
            There he has a wide coverage of his music, however he still has his own singles and collabs outside of those 

        </P>

            Well for a first, these three artists are of equal exposure crossing over to different people; therefore they are of equal status of co-operation and work well together.
            Not all of the music I have is listed for the respective collabs so I will be researching for some examples. 'Baracade' and 'Cinnamon sugar' are two examples.
        </p>

         <li><h3>Guillaume Muschalle</h3></li>
        <P>
            This artist is an underated secret weapon for the jazz sector of lofi, a smaller niche compared to RnB nad Hiphop.
            I believe in this persons skill after collabbing in Psalm trees' and Plusma's collabs albums.
        </p>

        <li><h3>Joint 6th Place</h3></li>
        <p>
            Nothing to see here ;) will keep updated once all tracks are filed under artist names in my collection.
