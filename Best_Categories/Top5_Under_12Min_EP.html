    <title>Short Snippets of Lofi</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Welcome to a taste of what Lofi is like</h2>

    <p>
        If you have just read the README and are intrigued to venture in this space with little effort, then this list is for you. <br>
        All Mini EP's here are great examples of what Lofi has to offer, whilst simultaneously being an appetizer of more to come. <br>
        EP's here seem to be in the Introduction category which is why I specifically decided under 12 Minutes, 4-5 tracks each EP max.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Strehlow - Sleep in Love</h3></li>
        <p>
            This is a wide range of intimate funk that will have you getting the goosies (in the best way). <br>
            The track revolves around RnB, funk and rythmic Jazz.
        </p>

        <li><h3>SwØrn - Escapade</h3></li>
        <p>
            A more upbeat track than the first, is more dynamic but I am unsure which is better interms of uniqueness and style.
        </p>

        <li><h3>Parkbench Epiphany - Antimidas </h3></li>
        <p>
            Lofi's secret weapon is the ability to soothe and destress, if you want to feel and confront your emotions, this EP is a way of doing so. <br>
            I advise not to do anything while thought intensive while listening to this to help lower cortisol levels.
        </p>

        <li><h3>Miscél - The other Side</h3></li>
        <p>
            This exposes you to the ability to create a world through music, like how some sounds are associated to comon blockbuster genres like sci-fi and so forth.
            Therefore a little bit more in deph of what stories Lofi can tell through little to no vocals. 

        </p>
        <li><h3>Psalm Trees X Guilliume Muschalle - Céleste</h3></li>
        <p>
            Needed for a variety of music that is chilled but effectively beutifull at the same time, giving you a healthy dopamine hit.
        </p>
    </ol>
    <p>Well that's all for our intro EP's into Lofi, I hope you leave your thoughts below!</p>
