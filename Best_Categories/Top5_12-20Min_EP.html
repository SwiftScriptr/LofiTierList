    <title>Quality tunes less than 20 mins</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>The following albums bring consistent joy</h2>
    <p>
        In this List, I struggled to give true representation to the best of many artists work; therefore there will surely be an overflow outside the Top5. <br>
        This segment is where majority of classic lofi resides IMO; as this timespan is a sweetspot of creativity and restrain for most composers; <br>
        Not too long to collect the scraps of ideas to fill half an hour, and not too short for the listener to ask for more. <br>
        Anyone who cannot produce respectable EP's within this cat doesn't deseve to be listened to (a personal belief of mine). 
    </p>    

    <ol>
        <li><h3>Ian Ewing - Almost Home</h3></li>

        <p>
           This tops the List due to it being a personal favorite of mine; it follows the format of a story told like a shortfilm/music video. <br>
           The following tracks are top quality and switch between the three genres Jazz, hipHop and funk, having splices of techno and synths. 
        </p>

        <li><h3>Junior State - Levitate</h3></li>

        <p>
            This has the embodiment of victory throughout the whole playlist, this is uplifting and encouraging so it had to be a close second on the list. <br>
            I loved the way how the major chords where used differently and sounded like it was a production instead of plain monotone music.
        </p>

        <li><h3>Arbour - Old Growth</h3></li>

        <p>
            Three words describe the attributes of this album; grungy, dynamic and funky. When first listening to this I didn't know what to expect (a little mature at the end), <br>
            and so neither will you as it truly has a 'controlled chaos' so to speak. There is quality and a uniqueness that seperates this from others so it is an aquired taste.
        </p>

        <li><h3>Ruck P - Destination</h3></li>

        <p>
            Is the most cohesive album of the two that he has done telling a story that ended up being more production based completing the story told. <br>
            The consistent use of vocals reflect the output and add to the emotion of the story better than his next album.
        </p>

        <li><h3>Sw√òrn - Reflection</h3></li>    

        <p>
            This was really Dynamic and I was glad it could make the top 5. It had more than 60% of great tunes and the implemented sounds used to create the tracks deserved it's own space.
        </p>

        <li><h3>Joint 6th place</h3></li>
        <p>
            No Spirit - Snacks: Of the two ablbums I have, this one better portrays the slow-fi chillhop genre. A clean smooth and dynamic EP allowing relaxation and multitasking. <br>
            <br>
            Evil Needle - Lost Tape: This is a favourite of mine but it does come with some complications, it is dynamic funky and a great piece, bbut needs headphone to be best experienced. <br>       
            It isn't a BlueWednesday but without headphones there can be a flat sensation, turning up the volume too far pops the bass with static. <br>
            <br>            
            Chillhop Beat Tapes Teddy Roxpin: Lastly, this beat tape is a solid treat; it is unique and playfull with the Dj vibes it produces.    <br>

        </p>

        <li><h3> The seventh Selection</h3></li>
        <p>
            Plusma & Guillaume Muschalle - Parasol: I appreciate the way this EP shows true Jazziness show casing brass instruments, which I used to play alot. <br>
            There's an appreciation of purely playable sounds weighing in at 80% whilst the the synthetics are 20%, all chords are bright majors and it's really a nostalgic goodtime record. <br>
            <br>
            Blue Wednesday - The Great Escape: This is his most diverse album, which is saying something as mostly he's a pianoholic. there's more bass and pitch changes in the keys used. <br>
            As the name suggests it is an ep cohesive enough to display a story which is just gratifiable for a change. <br>
            <br>
            Xander - Found Memories: There are tracks here on their own worth their salt, however, after a while, even when you listen periodically; you (well I) may find it repetetive. <br>
            There are chillhop staples in here better displayed as a refreshing uplifting burst of nostalgia on the livestreams and radio, but not the album as they become predictable.
